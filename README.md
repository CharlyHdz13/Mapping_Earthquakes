# Mapping Earthquakes
## Overview of the project
Using Leaflet, Open maps and GeoJSON, the project consisted in building a webpage that shows earthquakes around the globe for the last 7 days. 

## Results
The webpage looks like the following:

Where we can see the earthquakes that have occurred around the globe marked with a circle which its magnitude represents the magnitude of the earthquake. There is also an outline of the tectonic plates of the earth which helps better understand why there are lots of earthquakes in certain regions. Also a popup is shown for each circle showing the magnitude and location of the earthquake as the following image shows.

The map also allows for different tile layers to be displayed with the control.

This control also enables the user to toggle on and off the circle markers and the tectonic plates display.

## Conclusion
As a first approach to Leaflet and GeoJSON I found it pretty nice. I am now able to build maps using JavaScript and it enables me to further improve my knowledge of JavaScript.
